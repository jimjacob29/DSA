The are N balloons numbered from 1 to N. Every balloon has an another integer value Arr[i] assigned to it where i varies from 1 to N, and i represents the number of balloon.

A balloon at an odd position (i = 1, 3, 5. ) is happy if Arr[i] is odd.
A balloon at an even position (i = 2, 4, 6. ) is happy if Arr[i] is even.

Find the number of happy balloons.
