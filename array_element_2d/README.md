Given a 2D matrix of size M*N and element X. The task is to check whether the given element X is present in matrix or not.
Input
The first line contains three integers M(number of rows),N(Number of columns) and Q(number of queries)
Next M lines contains N integers which are the elements of the matrix.
Next Q lines will contains a single integer X.

Constraints:-
1<=N,M<=1000
1<=Q<=10000
1<=X, Arr[i]<=1000000000
Output
For each query, in a new line print "Yes" if the element is present in matrix or print "No" if the element is absent.
