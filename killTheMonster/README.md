Given the health of the monster H, the attack powers and weights of weapons, what is the minimum number of weapons required in order to kill the monster?

Note:- A weapon can only be used once.
Input
First line of input contains three space separated integers N, D and H.
Second line contains N space separated integers depicting the attack power of each weapon.
Third line of input contains the weight of each weapon.

Constraints:-
1 < = N < = 100000
1 < = D, Weight[i] < = 100000
1 < = H, Power[i] < = 100000000
Output
Print the minimum number of weapons required or print -1 if it is impossible to win the game.
