**Learning of DSA using Java**
You are given an array A of N integers. You will be given Q queries with two integers L and R. For each query, you need to find the sum of all elements of the array excluding the elements in the range [L, R] (both inclusive) modulo 109+7.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer N, the size of the array.
The second line of the input contains N integers, the elements of the array A.
The third line of the input contains an integer Q.
The next Q lines contain two integers L and R.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 200000
1 <= A[i] <= 1000000000
1 <= Q <= 100000
1 <= L <= R <= N
Output
Output Q lines, each having a single integer the answer to Q-th query modulo 109+7.
