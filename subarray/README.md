**Learning of DSA using Java**
You are given two integer arrays A and B of sizes N and M respectively. You need to modify the elements of A so that B becomes its subarray. Modifying an element means change the element to any other value.

Find the minimum number of modifications to achieve this.
Input
The first line of the input contains two integers N and M.
The second line of the input contains N space separated integers, the elements of array A.
The third line of the input contains M space separated integers, the elements of array B.

Constraints
1 <= M <= N <= 500
1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 10
Output
Output a single integer, the minimum number of modifications in A to make B its subarray.
