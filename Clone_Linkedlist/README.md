Given a linked list containing N nodes such that each nodes contains an additional random pointer, your task is to clone the given linked list into a new list and return the new head.

Input
User Task:
Since this will be a functional problem, you don't have to take input. You just have to complete the function CloneList() that takes the head of given list as parameter.

Constraints:
1 < = N < = 1000
1 < = Node. val < = 1000

Custom Input:-
First line of input should contains the number of Nodes N. Second line of input should contains N space separated integers depicting the data at each node. Last line of input should N space separated integers contains the number of the node the random pointer is pointing to.

For eg:-
5
2 7 8 8 3
1 2 2 3 2
Output
You don't need to print anything you just need to return the head of the new list. You will get 1 if the cloning is done properly else you will get 0.
