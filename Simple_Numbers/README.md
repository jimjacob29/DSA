You think that integers divisible by K are nice. Given L and R (L<=R), find the number of nice integers from L to R (both inclusive).
Input
First Line of input contains three integers L R K

Constraints :
0 <= L <= R <= 1000000000000000000(10^18)
1 <= K <= 1000000000000000000(10^18)
Output
Output a single integer which is the number of nice integers from L to R (both inclusive).
