Given an unsorted array A[] of integers and size N, and an element X, you need to find the Minimum Number of Elements required to be added to this array so the new median of array becomes X.
Median of array is middle element of array in its sorted form. For odd number of elements N it is the element at position (N-1)/2. For even number of elements N, it is (A[N/2] + A[(N/2) - 1])/2.

Try without sorting the array
