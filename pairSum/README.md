Given an array Arr, of N integers find the sum of max(A[i], A[j]) for all i, j such that i < j.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer N, the size of the array.
The second line of the input contains N integers, the elements of the array Arr.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 100000
1 <= Arr[i] <= 100000000
Output
Print a single integer which is the sum of min(A[i], A[j]) for all i, j such that i < j.
