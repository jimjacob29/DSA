**Learning of DSA using Java**

You are given an array A consisting of N number and an empty set S. For each pair of numbers A[i] and A[j] in the array (i < j), you need to find their LCM and insert the LCM into the set S.

You need to report the GCD of the elements in set S.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer N.
The second line of the input contains N space separated integers A[1], A[2],. , A[N].

Constraints
2 <= N <= 100000
1 <= A[i] <= 200000
Output
Output a single integer, the GCD of LCM set S.
