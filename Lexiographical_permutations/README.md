Find the lexicographically smallest permutation P of integers from 1 to N such that:
1. It should not be strictly increasing i. e. there must be an i such that P[i] < P[i-1] for 2 <= i <= N
2. Sum of every three consecutive elements should be divisible by 3.
Input
The only line of input contains a single integer N, denoting the number of elements in the permutation.

3 <= N <= 15
Output
Print a single line containing N space separated integers denoting the elements of the permutation.
